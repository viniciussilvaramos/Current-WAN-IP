# Current-WAN-IP
A extremely simple python scritp to check your current WAN IP and send it in a e-mail

This python script only reads the current IP WAN of a DDWRT router and sends it to a specified email.
It is not intended to be used in a productive environment, so be careful because the passwords in the script need to be in clean text.
